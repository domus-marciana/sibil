== Variables ==
There are currently two types of variables in the Sibil language:

 * Integers: They follow the naming rules in C/C++, e.g. `var`, `var1`.
 * Strings: They follow the naming rules in C/C++, but has a `$` (dollar sign) preceding them, e.g. `$var`, `$var1`.

== Expressions ==
Expressions are modeled after C.

Exceptions:
 * `mod`: equivalent to `%` in C.
 * `and` `or` `not`: equivalent to `&&` `||` `!` in C.
 * `is`: equivalent to `==` in C.
 * `is not`: equivalent to `!=` in C.

== Commands ==
Commands in Sibil are the following:

=== Set variable ===
`var_name = value`

=== Print ===
`print arg1 [, arg2...]`

 * `arg` can be expression, variable, or string.

=== If-statement ===
`if expression then commands [else commands]` or
{{{
if expression:
    commands
[else:
    commands]
endif
}}}

=== Loop ===
